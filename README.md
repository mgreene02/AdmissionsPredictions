# AdmissionsPredictions
This report uses KNN to predict admissions decisions with up to 85% accuracy on testing sets (See Figure 1). The next code uses Logistic regression to determine matriculation probabilties. Although this model was used to check the work of a different model, the performance was nearly identical, but both models made predictions of around 75% accuracy, which I consider very poor because approximates 25% of students matriculate at the university from which the data was drawn. This means that the models effectively predicted no one to matricualte and was correct 75% of the time which gives very little meaning. Further refinement is in process.
