This report uses KNN to predict admissions decisions with upto 85% accuracy on testing sets (See Figure 1). The next code uses Logistic regression to determine matriculation probabilties. Although this model was used to check the work of a different model, the perfromance was nearly identical, but both models made poor predictions.
